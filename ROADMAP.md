- [x] Configured Edge Functions for data processing (polygon-data and seed-patterns)

### Backtest Analysis (✅ COMPLETED)
- [x] Developed comprehensive backtest analysis script
- [x] Implemented pattern performance metrics calculation
- [x] Generated statistical breakdown by timeframe and pattern type
- [x] Latest results show 69.88% win rate with a 99.29 risk/reward ratio

- [x] Added filtering capabilities by pattern type, timeframe, and channel type
- [x] Implemented advanced sorting by confidence score and performance metrics

## Current Subscription: Stocks Starter
We currently have the **Stocks Starter** subscription which includes:
- All US Stocks Tickers with 100% Market Coverage
- 5 Years Historical Data 
- **15-minute Delayed Data** (important limitation)
- Minute Aggregates, WebSockets, Snapshot
- Reference Data, Fundamentals, Technical Indicators

Due to the 15-minute delay in our current subscription, we will:
1. Only use 15min, 30min, and 1hour timeframes for the Day Trading Scanner
2. For the Swing Trading Scanner, the delay is less impactful for 4hour, daily, and weekly timeframes
3. Ensure the UI clearly indicates data is delayed by 15 minutes
4. Design patterns that account for this delay

## Next Steps

### Pattern Detection Refinement
- **Pattern Quality**
  - [X] Implement channel type detection (horizontal, ascending, descending)
  - [X] Add multi-timeframe confirmations
  - [X] Improve pattern quality scoring
  - [ ] Add more pattern types (Cup & Handle, Head & Shoulders)
  - [ ] Implement AI-assisted pattern validation

### 2. UI Development
- [X] Create intuitive scanner dashboard with toggle between Day and Swing modes
- [X] Add sorting by confidence and recency
- [X] Implement timeframe filtering customized for each scanner type
- [X] Add prominent "15-minute delayed data" disclaimer
- [X] Integrate backtest performance metrics display
- [X] Show only stocks with valid channel patterns and breakout potential
- [ ] Add advanced filtering options based on consistency score and win rate
- [ ] Implement custom watchlists for personal pattern tracking
- [ ] Add real-time updates for pattern status changes

### 3. Future Infrastructure Updates (2025)
- [ ] Monitor Supabase API key format changes (scheduled for 2025)
- [ ] Update to new Supabase key format when available (`sb_publishable_123abc` and `sb_secret_123abc`)
- [ ] Complete migration before October 1, 2025 deadline
- [ ] Consider upgrade to Stocks Advanced plan for real-time data access
- [ ] Implement advanced caching strategy to optimize API usage
- [ ] Add support for more complex pattern types requiring real-time data

## Target Universe: Two-Tiered Approach

### Day Trading Scanner
- **Target Stocks**: 20 high-volume stocks with 0 DTE options capability
- **Indices**: SPY, QQQ
- **Timeframes**: 15min, 30min, 1hour only (due to data delay limitations)
- **Use Case**: Intraday trading and 0-1 DTE options

### Swing Trading Scanner
- **Target Stocks**: Nasdaq 100 stocks only
- **Timeframes**: 4hour, daily, weekly
- **Use Case**: Position trading with 1-4 week options expiry

The Swing Trading Scanner benefits from focusing on a limited universe (Nasdaq 100) while still providing valuable trade setups. The 15-minute data delay is less impactful for these longer timeframes.
