*Note: Current data limitations restrict our analysis primarily to the 1-hour timeframe. Multi-timeframe confirmation analysis will be expanded as more data becomes available.*

## Multi-Timeframe Analysis

The current implementation of multi-timeframe analysis focuses on confirming patterns across the 15m, 30m, and 1h timeframes. Due to the 15-minute data delay from our current Stocks Starter subscription, we prioritize these timeframes to maintain data accuracy.

### Lower Timeframe Predictions

Our system analyzes whether patterns identified in lower timeframes (15m, 30m) successfully predict breakouts in higher timeframes (1h). This confirmation approach helps reduce false positives and increases overall pattern reliability.

## Consistency Score Explanation

The consistency score is a proprietary metric that measures the predictability and reliability of pattern performance. It is calculated based on:

1. The standard deviation of profit/loss percentages
2. Win rate stability across different channel types
3. Consistency of candles-to-breakout across patterns

A score above 90 indicates highly predictable performance with minimal variance, providing traders with confidence in the expected behavior of identified patterns.

## Backtesting Methodology

Our backtesting approach:

1. Identifies historical patterns based on specified criteria
2. Simulates entry at pattern identification
3. Tracks price movement until breakout or invalidation
4. Calculates performance metrics based on actual price action
5. Aggregates results to evaluate overall strategy effectiveness

## Future Enhancements

1. **Extended Timeframe Analysis**: As data capabilities expand, we will incorporate 4-hour, daily, and weekly timeframes for comprehensive swing trading analysis.

2. **Pattern Type Expansion**: We plan to add support for additional pattern types such as Cup & Handle and Head & Shoulders patterns.

3. **AI-Enhanced Pattern Recognition**: Implementing machine learning to improve pattern detection accuracy and reduce false positives.

4. **Real-Time Performance Tracking**: Integration of real-time updates for active patterns to track live performance against historical benchmarks.

## Subscription Limitations

The current Stocks Starter subscription imposes certain limitations:

1. 15-minute delayed data
2. Limited to 100 requests per minute to Polygon.io API
3. Some advanced features are constrained due to API limits

We continuously optimize our pattern detection and backtesting algorithms to work efficiently within these constraints while delivering maximum value.
